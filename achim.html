    <h2>FOSS United: Our Inspiration</h2>
    <p>
        Our team is committed to building a future where technology is accessible, open, and inclusive. 
        We are inspired by the journey of the <strong>FOSS United Foundation</strong>, which has been a catalyst 
        for open-source innovation in India since 2020.
